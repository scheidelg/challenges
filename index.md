# Greg's Challenges

This web site contains a collection of homegrown challenges and exercises relating to information technology and information security, intended to test and hone the reader's skills. Generally a scenario is presented along with one or more questions or objectives, perhaps along with some hints or information about resources. A solution is then provided, perhaps with a discussion or walk-through.

There's a fine line between an 'exercise' and a 'challenge'. I tend to use 'exercise' (or sometimes 'lab') to refer to a well-defined scenario with a specific set of objectives that should be met to practice or illustrate a specific tool or technology. An exercise will generally be strongly guided and built around specific steps that can be taken to meet the objectives - but hopefully allowing for a bit of freedom for creativity and alternate approaches (after all, [TMTOWTDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it) <sup>[&#91;1&#93;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it)</sup>).

I tend to use 'challenge', on the other hand, to refer to questions or puzzles that are more free-form in how they can be answered or solved; are intended to challenge the reader's technical or critical thinking skills; and are often intended to hone the reader's ability to use specific techniques, tools, or commands.

The contents of this web site are challenges and exercises that I've created either myself or in collaboration with others. I'll keep adding to this over time - starting with trying to pull together and decipher notes from things I threw together while at work or teaching classes.

No warranty expressed or implied; use at your own risk; YMMV.

## Additional Resources

There are a vast number of resources on the Web that provide excellent challenges and exercises. See [Greg's Desk](https://www.scheidel.net) / [Challenges & Exercises]((https://www.scheidel.net/challenges_and_exercises.md) / [Additional Resources](https://www.scheidel.net/challenges_and_exercises.md#Additional_Resources)<sup>[&#91;5&#93;](https://www.scheidel.net/challenges_and_exercises.md#Additional_Resources)</sup> for a starter list.

Please also check out [Greg's CDNW v1 Walkthrough](https://cdnwv1.scheidel.net) at [https://cdnwv1.scheidel.net](). I intend to use that web site to post hints, tips, and walk-through instructions for every question in version 1 of the [Cyber Defense NetWars](https://www.sans.org/netwars/cyber-defense)<sup>[&#91;4&#93;](https://www.sans.org/netwars/cyber-defense)</sup> (CDNW) game... After [Eric Conrad](https://www.sans.org/instructors/eric-conrad) officially retires CDNW v1 and grants me permission to publish my notes.
